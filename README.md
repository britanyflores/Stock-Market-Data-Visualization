# Stock Market Data Visualization

**Objective:** This program creates a live stock marker data visualization of any ticker the user selects and shows details of the high, low, open and closing prices of the ticker. The user also has the option to decide if they want to modify the period and interval

### Running code without period and interval modification

**Description:** Launching the program without user modification for the period and interval and allowing the user select the ticker (Default: Period = 1d, Ticker = 1m)

## Notes
**Things to improve:** Future improvements would include adding try-except blocks to handle mistakes from the user when modifying period and interval data 

**Biggest challenge:** My biggest challenge was working with the Yahoo Finance API because it was my first time using an API in python
